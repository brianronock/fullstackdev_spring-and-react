# üìñ Full Stack Engineering with Spring Boot & React

Welcome to the companion repository for the book **‚ÄúFull Stack Engineering with Spring Boot & React‚Äù**.  
This repo mirrors the journey of the book: from building a clean backend API, to connecting a frontend, to securing, scaling, and deploying the application.

Each **Part** of the book has its own folder, and each **Chapter** is represented as a Git branch so you can follow along step by step.

---

## üéØ Who This Book Is For
- Students and self-learners who want to understand **end-to-end web development**.  
- Backend developers curious about frontend, or frontend devs who want to learn backend skills.  
- Engineers who want to go beyond ‚Äújust making it work‚Äù and understand **why** certain design choices are made.  

We use **Spring Boot 3.x (Java)** for the backend and **React (JavaScript)** for the frontend, while also comparing these choices with alternatives in other stacks (Node.js, .NET, Django, Vue, etc.).
