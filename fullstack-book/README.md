# Fullstack Book Website

This is the documentation site for the **Fullstack Development with Spring Boot and React** book project. It is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and deployed automatically via GitHub Actions.

## Installation

```bash
yarn
```

## Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment


The site is automatically deployed to **GitHub Pages**.  
ðŸ‘‰ The live site is available here: [brianronock.github.io/fullstackdev_spring-and-react](https://brianronock.github.io/fullstackdev_spring-and-react/)

## Note for Learners

When you clone this repository, you will only see the **Docusaurus scaffold**.  
The actual book content (chapters, blog posts, images, tools) is kept in a **private source repository** to keep this repo lightweight and focused.

That means:
- You can install and run the Docusaurus dev server (`yarn start`) â€” it will start fine.
- The site will not show the full book content locally.
- To read the complete material, visit the live site: [brianronock.github.io/fullstackdev_spring-and-react](https://brianronock.github.io/fullstackdev-spring-and-react/)

This way, you donâ€™t need to handle extra files or tools â€” everything you need to learn is already available on the published site.
