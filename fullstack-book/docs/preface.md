# **Preface**

Welcome to *Full Stack Development with Spring Boot and React*! This
book is written by **Brian Rono CK,** a full-stack software engineer, with
the goal of teaching you how to build a complete web application-from a
robust backend API to a dynamic frontend interface-using the popular
combo of Spring Boot (Java) and React (JavaScript). This expanded
edition is deliberately verbose and educational. We will not just show
you code, but also dive deep into *why* we make certain design choices,
compare alternatives, and discuss best practices. This is a **hands-on
guide** that encourages you to **code along** from start to finish. Each
chapter builds on the last, and our companion GitHub repository contains
incremental branches for every chapter so you can compare your work and
recover if you get stuck. The appendices at the back of the book provide
quick references, troubleshooting tips, and extra context to help you
deepen your skills.

**What to Expect**: We<span dir="rtl">’</span>ll walk step-by-step
through constructing a product management system, with a Spring Boot
RESTful API as the backend and a React single-page application (SPA) as
the frontend. Along the way, we<span dir="rtl">’</span>ll break down
every decision:

We start with the **backend**, using Spring Boot 3.x to create a REST
API. You<span dir="rtl">’</span>ll learn about layered architecture
(controllers, services, repositories), mapping objects with JPA and
MapStruct, validation, error handling, security considerations like
CORS and JWT-based authentication, caching with Redis, database
migrations with Flyway, and how to test your backend.
We<span dir="rtl">’</span>ll also cover observability using Spring
Boot Actuator and Prometheus.

Then we move to the **frontend**, using React (with modern tools like
Vite) to build a responsive interface. We cover component structure,
state management with hooks, communicating with the backend API,
handling forms and validations, showing notifications, and making the
app responsive and user-friendly.

Throughout, we<span dir="rtl">’</span>ll highlight **common
pitfalls**, give analogies, and point out alternative approaches. For
instance, we<span dir="rtl">’</span>ll explain why we use BigDecimal
for money instead of floating-point, or how GraphQL or gRPC could be
alternatives to REST in some cases.

Uniquely, this book **compares the design choices** we make with those
in other languages and frameworks. Full stack engineering principles
are universal: separating concerns, using MVC or similar patterns,
ensuring scalability. We will discuss how our approach in Java + React
parallels or differs from, say, a Node.js + Angular stack, a Python
Django application, or a Ruby on Rails project.

**Who Is This For?** If you have basic knowledge of Java (classes,
interfaces, annotations) and some familiarity with web development
(HTTP, JSON) and JavaScript/React fundamentals,
you<span dir="rtl">’</span>re the perfect audience. Beginners will
appreciate the step-by-step explanations and intermediate developers
will find depth in best practices and architectural reasoning. We assume
you<span dir="rtl">’</span>ve set up a Java development environment and
know how to run a Spring Boot app (Maven or Gradle) and a Node-based
toolchain for React. No prior Spring experience is
required-we<span dir="rtl">’</span>ll introduce it as a framework that
<span dir="rtl">“</span>just takes care of a lot of boilerplate for
you.” Whether you<span dir="rtl">’</span>ve used Maven or Gradle before,
you<span dir="rtl">’</span>ll see both in action here, and we include an
appendix showing exactly how to migrate from Maven (used in the early
chapters) to Gradle (used in later chapters).

**How to Use This Book:** This book is structured to encourage active
learning.

> **Code along with each chapter:** You<span dir="rtl">’</span>ll learn
> more by typing the code yourself than by copy-pasting.
>
> **Run the app frequently:** Test after each major change to catch
> problems early.
>
> **Experiment:** Tweak values, refactor code, and try variations.
>
> **Use GitHub branches:** The companion repository contains a branch
> for every chapter so you can compare your work or recover from
> mistakes.
>
> **Refer to the appendices:** From command-line cheat sheets to Spring
> Boot annotation references, they<span dir="rtl">’</span>re designed
> for quick access.

Each chapter builds on the previous one, and by the end of Part I (the
backend), you<span dir="rtl">’</span>ll have a running REST API. By the
end of Part II (the frontend), you<span dir="rtl">’</span>ll have a
complete application with a polished UI. Part III adds advanced backend
features, Part IV enhances the frontend, and Part V takes you through
DevOps, infrastructure, and deployment.

**How This Book Differs from Others**: Most full stack books either
focus heavily on one side of the stack and skim the other, provide only
code snippets with minimal explanation or skip over real-world tooling,
workflows, and troubleshooting. This book is different because:

> **We build a single project from start to finish**, showing every
> step, including setup, configuration, and common mistakes.
>
> **We compare alternative technologies and approaches**, so you
> understand the <span dir="rtl">“</span>*why*” behind decisions.
>
> W**e integrate professional workflows**, like GitHub branching, code
> reviews, Maven-to-Gradle migration, API testing, and deployment
> checklists.
>
> **We give you incremental code branches** so you can join at any
> chapter without feeling lost.
>
> **We include detailed appendices** that double as a
> developer<span dir="rtl">’</span>s quick reference manual.

**Table of Contents**: We provide a roadmap of chapters for both backend
and frontend sections. Feel free to jump to specific topics if you need
to (for example, you might reference the chapter on Global Exception
Handling when you encounter errors), but the recommended approach is to
follow in sequence for a cohesive understanding.
